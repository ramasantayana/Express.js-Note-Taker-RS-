# Express.js-Note-Taker-RS-

I have created an application called Note Taker that could be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Here is the link of the application: https://notetaker-rs.herokuapp.com/

While creating this application, I have received guidance and help from my tutor Suresh Kumar
